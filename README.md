## Cancer Killing Robots

A side project inspired by swarm robotics course.
A simple playground for doing distributed control of "cancer state" with a hodge-podge of ideas.

## Overview

Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in today's world.
Finding targeted therapies to treat cancer is a major effort in science and industry.

From a scientific perspective, cancer is a major challenge to identify and manage.
From a mathematical perspective, cancer exhibits some stereotyped behaviors that we haven't fully characterized or leveraged in our therapeutic efforts.


## Approach

I'll try to frame cancer as a dynamical disease, identify regions of the statespace associated with disease pathology. All in simulation but the goal is to develop the library in an abstract enough way that it could, theoretically, be used in some sort of future nano-bot.

*Disclaimer: I am not an expert in cancer biology. This repo is, instead, an attempt to apply basic control theory models towards the identification/inference of cancer-related dynamics and subsequent treatment/control of those dynamics. The focus is on the control properties of the model, not on the construct validity of the model with respect to any particular form of cancer*.

## Background
Cancer is a general class of clinical disease where there's a problem with cell proliferation leading to hyperproliferation, impaired functioning of normal tissue, spread to other regions/functional systems, and non-responsive to the intrinsic signaling pathways of the body.

This isn't a new idea at all; mathematical modeling of cancer has a rich history () and is only growing faster today ().
